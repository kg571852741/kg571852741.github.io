<span class='show_paper_citations' data='DhtAFkwAAAAJ:ALROH1vI_8AC'></span>

I am Ka Lung Cheung, a Ph.D. candidate specializing in Mechanical and Automation Engineering at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) . Under the mentorship of [Prof. Ben Men Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=utlWXV0AAAAJ&hl=en) within the [CUHK Unmanned System Research Group](http://www.mae.cuhk.edu.hk/~usr/), my research lies on technologies that contribute to Smart Cities, 3D Vision, and Scan-to-BIM automation. 

My current research projects include the development of a fully-automated Scan-to-BIM framework, deep learning-based methodologies for photorealistic outdoor scenes synthesis and completion, as well as scene reconstruction and semantic segmentation. I have contributed to leading international AI conferences and workshops, as detailed in [Publication](#publications).

I'm open to new collaborations and research opportunities. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:klcheung@mae.cuhk.edu.hk) for discussions or idea sharing.

<!-- In the past, I conducted research on the Urban Heat Island effect, focusing on simulating and predicting canopy-level urban air temperatures at the neighborhood scale. Additionally, I contributed to synthetic architectural exterior dataset and fully automated scan-to-BIM pipeline with ViT. -->
