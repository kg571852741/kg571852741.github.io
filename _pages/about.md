I am Ka Lung Cheung, P.h.D student specializing in ophthalmology at [The Univrersity of Hong Kong](https://www.hku.hk/). Under the mentorship of [Prof. Christopher K.S. Leung](https://www.ophthalmology.hku.hk/academic-and-clinical-staff-%E6%95%99%E5%AD%B8%E5%8F%8A%E8%87%A8%E5%BA%8A%E8%81%B7%E5%93%A1/professor-christopher-k-s-leung-%E6%A2%81%E5%95%9F%E4%BF%A1%E6%95%99%E6%8E%88), my research lies on technologies that contribute to 3D vision, early glacoma detection and medical image analysis. I have contributed to leading international AI conference and workshop and jounral, as detailed in [Publication](#publications). 

<!-- My current research projects include deep learning-based methodologies for 3D assets synthesis, as well as semantic scene reconstruction, segmentation.  -->

I'm open to new collaborations and research opportunities. Feel free to [reach out](mailto:dklcheung@connect.hku.hk) for discussions or idea sharing.

<!-- In the past, I conducted research on the Urban Heat Island effect, focusing on simulating and predicting canopy-level urban air temperatures at the neighborhood scale. Additionally, I contributed to synthetic architectural exterior dataset and fully automated scan-to-BIM pipeline with ViT. -->
